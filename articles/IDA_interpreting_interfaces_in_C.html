		<p>In the C++ language, we have something that is called a class. A class is essentially a C struct, containing some data and functions. It may contain members or member functions that are either private, public or protected. It may also contain just a single base class (single inheritance) or a couple dozens of them (multiple inheritance), as we may have seen in some complicated class hierarchies. Well, in this article I will explain how to carefully define classes in IDA, so that the IDA's decompiler can turn these nasty offsets into actual members or member functions of the particular class.</p>

		<h2>The basics</h2>

		<p>So as you may know, it's possible to upload a C header into IDA, which will be then turned into defined data that you can apply while reversing. For example, you create a header file, declare a struct there, upload it to IDA and then the struct is defined inside IDA, simple as that. This is how we'll define the C++ classes. But wait, how can we declare a C++ class inside a C header file? Well, we can, however it requires some knowledge of how the linker structures classes in the memory.</p>

		<p>As an example we'll look on how interfaces are made inside the GoldSrc engine.</p>

		<h2>Goldsource interfaces</h2>

		<p>Many of the examples listed below are being applied in various applications. I've picked the GoldSrc environment since that's what I've been most comfortable with in this particular case with interfaces.</p>

		<p>In this example, we'll have an IInterface pure virtual class and class that inherits from IInterface called CClass. This class will contain one member called data and some virtual and non-virtual member functions to fully illustrate the concept. But first, let's take a look just at the interface class.</p>

		<h2>Interface declaration and memory layout</h2>

<code>// A base class for the interfaces - see Virtual Destructors for more information
// Every interface in GS has this as a base class
class IBaseInterface
{
    virtual ~IBaseInterface() {}
};

// Our interface class
class IInterface : IBaseInterface
{
public:
    virtual void a() = 0;
    virtual void b() = 0;
    virtual void c() = 0;
};
</code>

		<p>As you can see, the interface is pretty straightforward. It contains some pure virtual methods and that's about it. Now, this interface cannot be declared alone, it has to be a base class for some other class that will override all of its methods. The interface shouldn't contain any members, only pure virtual methods. And now, let's see how would be this interface class represented behind the curtain, inside memory.</p>

<code>class IInterface
    +---
 0  | IInterface_vftbl* __vftable // The VF table is always the first member
 4  +---

// An virtual function table for the class IInterface
class IInterface_vftbl
    +---
 0  | &IInterface::a
 4  | &IInterface::b
 8  | &IInterface::c
12  +---
</code>

		<p>This is the memory layout of the IInterface class. Now let's have a little talk about how this works. So as you can see, the first thing inside the class is the VFT, which is essentially a pointer to an array of pointers, each pointing to a virtual function address declared in the interface. This is always the first thing inside a class with virtual methods.</p>

		<p>Next, lets add the CClass that will have IInterface as a base class.</p>

		<h2>Using the interface in practice</h2>

<code>class CClass : IInterface
{
public:
    void a() override {} // Just for the logic sake
    void b() override {}
    void c() override {}

public:
    virtual void do_bad_stuff() {}   // These two create a new VFT entry for this class
    virtual void do_nice_stuffd() {}

    void do_class_things() {}        // Isn't included inside VFT

public:
    int data;
};
</code>

		<p>In this code, the CClass has a IIterface class as the base class and must override it's members. It also contains a member called data of a type of integer. Now let's see how this would </p>

<code>// Original VFT for IInterface
class IInterface_vftbl
    +---
 0  | &IInterface::a
 4  | &IInterface::b
 8  | &IInterface::c
12  +---

class CClass_vftbl
    +---
 0  |  __vftable_iinterface  // First comes the base interface (non pointer!)
12  | &CClass::do_bad_stuff  // Then virtual members from our class
16  | &CClass::do_nice_stuff
20  +---

class CClass_mbrs
    +---
 0  | data
 4  +---

class CClass
    +---
 0  | CClass_vftbl* __vftable
 4  | CClass_mbrs   __members
12  +---
</code>

		<p>Okay so first thing is the IInterface VFT declaration from the previous figure. We use this inside the CClass VFT, where what follows are the CClass virtual methods, however not the non-virtual method! Pointer to this VFT is then included as the first thing inside CClass, and after that the class members follows. Simple as that.</p>

		<h2>Representation in a C header</h2>

		<p>Now when we understand the basics of how the linker forms the object memory layout, we can start defining the class insider a C header using struct. As an example we'll use the class A from the previous multiple-inheritance figure.</p>

		<p>Now, this may seem pretty hard, but in reality is simple. If you're scared of what's following, you should go back and get more familiar of how the memory of a class is structured. Okay so, assuming that you have the enough knowledge of how this works, let's get into it.</p>

<code>// cclass.h

// Have to do some forward declarations because the VFT structs
// uses their classes before their declared.
struct IInterface;
struct CClass;

// VFT for IInterface
struct IInterface_vftbl
{
    void (__thiscall* a)(IInterface* this);
    void (__thiscall* b)(IInterface* this);
    void (__thiscall* c)(IInterface* this);
};

struct IInterface
{
    IInterface_vftbl* __vftable;
};

// VFT for CClass that also contains IInterface virtual methods
struct CClass_vftbl
{
    // VFT for IInterface
    IInterface_vftbl __vftable_iinterface;

    void (__thiscall* do_bad_stuff)(CClass* this);
    void (__thiscall* do_nice_stuff)(CClass* this);
};

struct CClass_mbrs
{
    int data;
};

struct CClass
{
    CClass_vftbl* __vftable;
    CClass_mbrs   __members;
};

</code>

		<p>The CClass class that inherits from the IInterface in C++ can be represented like this in a C structure. This structure can be then uploaded into IDA and finally applied in practice.</p>

		<h2>Even more inheritance</h2>
		
		<p>Assume that we have another class called CAnotherClass and this class has a base class CClass. Now what? We already know how to declare a class inheriting from a pure virtual interface, however what if the base class has some data in it? Let's declare such class.</p>

<code>class CAnotherClass : CClass
{
public:
    virtual void hello() {};
    virtual void bye() {};

public:
    char more_data[16];
    float even_more_data;
};
</code>

		<p>So this class has yet another two member functions and two members. Let's see how this is all lied in memory.</p>

<code>// Original VFT for IInterface
class IInterface_vftbl
    +---
 0  | &IInterface::a
 4  | &IInterface::b
 8  | &IInterface::c
12  +---

class CClass_vftbl
    +---
0   | IInterface_vftbl __vftable // First comes the base interface (non pointer!)
12  | &CClass::do_bad_stuff      // Then virtual members from our class
16  | &CClass::do_nice_stuff
20  +---

class CClass_mbrs
    +---
 0  | data
 4  +---

class CAnotherClass_vftbl
    +---
0   | __vftable_cclass       // CClass VFT containing IInterface VFT
20  | &CAnotherClass::hello  // Virtual methods of CAnotherClass
24  | &CAnotherClass::bye
28  +---

class CAnotherClass_mbrs
    +---
 0  | __members_cclass // First members of CClass
 4  | more_data
20  | even_more_data
24  +---

class CAnotherClass
    +---
 0  | CAnotherClass_vftbl* __vftable;
 4  | CAnotherClass_mbrs   __members;
32  +---
</code>

		<p>The thing that we have to note there is the fact that everything starts to kind of lay on top of each other. This pattern essentially never fails even with classes with dozens of inheritance and thousands of bytes of data. Let's now see the representation in a C header.</p>

		<h2>Representation in a C header</h2>

<code>// canotherclass.h
	
struct CAnotherClass;

// VFT for CAnotherClass also containing CClass VFT
struct CAnotherClass_vftbl
{
    // VFT for CClass
    CClass_vftbl __vftable_cclass; // No pointer!

    // Virtual methods of CAnotherClass
    void(__thiscall* hello)(CAnotherClass* this);
    void(__thiscall* bye)(CAnotherClass* this);
    // ... possibly more
};

struct CAnotherClass_mbrs
{
    char more_data[16];
    float even_more_data;
};

struct CAnotherClass
{
    CAnotherClass_vftbl* __vftable;

    // First the members of CClass
    CClass_mbrs          __members_cclass;
    
    // Then our members
    CAnotherClass_mbrs   __members;
};
</code>

		<p>And that's it. If you find this kinda complicated, that's alright. It's understandable that you may not get the concept in just one reading, especially if you're new to all of this. On the other hand, I hope that this text is somewhat readable and understandable. With this kind of pattern you can express any class you want, no matter how complex it is.</p>
